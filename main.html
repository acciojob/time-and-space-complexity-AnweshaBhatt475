	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the computational 
		efficiency of an algorithm, indicating how its runtime 
		changes as the size of the input increases. It provides 
		a way to analyze how efficient an algorithm is in terms 
		of time required to solve a problem. Common notations 
		like O(n), O(log n), and O(nÂ²) describe the growth rate,
		helping developers choose the most efficient solution for a given problem.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory or storage
		required by an algorithm to execute, including both fixed 
		and variable parts. Fixed space includes constants and program 
		instructions, while variable space accounts for dynamic
		memory allocation like input data and temporary variables.
		It is often expressed in Big O notation, such as O(n),
		where n represents the size of the input. For instance,
		if an algorithm needs memory proportional to the input size, 
		its space complexity is O(n), indicating
		that the memory usage grows linearly with the input.</p>
